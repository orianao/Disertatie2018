ABSTRACT = {We present a new method for automatic detection of peaks in noisy periodic and quasi-periodic signals. The new method, called automatic multiscale-based peak detection (AMPD), is based on the calculation and analysis of the local maxima scalogram, a matrix comprising the scale-dependent occurrences of local maxima. The usefulness of the proposed method is shown by applying the AMPD algorithm to simulated and real-world signals.},
